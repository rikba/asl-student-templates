abstract = {The research on autonomous miniature flying robots has intensified considerably thanks to the recent growth of civil and military interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). This paper summarizes the final results of the modeling and control parts of OS4 project, which focused on design and control of a quadrotor. It introduces a simulation model which takes into account the variation of the aerodynamical coefficients due to vehicle motion. The control parameters found with this model are successfully used on the helicopter without re-tuning. The last part of this paper describes the control approach (integral backstepping) and the scheme we propose for full control of quadrotors (attitude, altitude and position). Finally, the results of autonomous take-off, hover, landing and collision avoidance are presented.},

We formulate a predictive control problem in order to best follow a given path by controlling the front steering angle, brakes and traction at the four wheels independently, while fulfilling various physical and design constraints. At each time step a trajectory is assumed to be known over a finite horizon, and an MPC controller computes the system inputs in order to best follow the desired trajectory on slippery roads at a given entry speed. We start from the results presented in [1], [2] and formulate the MPC problem based on successive on-line linearization of the nonlinear vehicle model (LTV MPC). Simulative results are presented, interpreted and compared against LTV MPC schemes which make use only of steering and/or braking.},

The UAV has four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts, that are used to control the six translational and rotational degrees of freedom, and to achieve asymptotic tracking of four outputs, namely, three position variables for the vehicle center of mass and the direction of one vehicle body-fixed axis. A globally defined model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics is introduced as a basis for the analysis. A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group SE(3) and it is shown to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global.

@article{Ma2001,
abstract = {This book is intended to give students at the advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate level and researchers in computer vision, robotics, and computer graphics a self-contained introduction to the geometry of 3-D vision: that is, the reconstruction of 3-D models of objects from a collection of 2-D images. The only prerequisite for this book is a course in linear algebra at the undergraduate level. As timely research summary, two bursts of manuscripts were published in the past on a geometric approach to computer vision: the ones that were published in mid 1990’s on the geometry of two views (e.g., Faugeras 1993, Weng, Ahuja and Huang 1993, Maybank 1993), and the ones that were recently published on the geometry of multiple views (e.g., Hartley and Zisserman 2000, Faugeras, Luong and Papadopoulo 2001).1 While a majority of those manuscripts were to summarize up to date research results by the time they were published, we sense that now the time is ripe for putting a coherent part of that material in a unified and yet simplified framework which can be used for pedegogical purposes. Although the approach we are to take here deviates from those old ones and the techniques we use are mainly linear algebra, this book nonetheless gives a comprehensive coverage of what is known to date on the geometry of 3-D vision. It also builds on a homogeneous terminology a solid analytical foundation for future research in this young field. This book is organized as follows. Following a brief introduction, Part I provides background materials for the rest of the book. Two fundamental transformations in multiple view geometry, namely the rigid-body motion and perspective projection, are introduced in Chapters 2 and 3 respectively. Image formation and feature extraction are discussed in Chapter 4. The two chapters in Part II cover the classic theory of two view geometry based on the so-called epipolar constraint. Theory and algorithms are developed for both discrete and continuous motions, and for both calibrated and uncalibrated camera models. Although the epipolar constraint has been very successful in the two view case, Part III shows that a more proper tool for studying the geometry of multiple views is the so-called rank condition on the multiple view matrix, which trivially implies all the constraints among multiple images that are known to date, in particular the epipolar constraint. The theory culminates in Chapter 10 with a unified theorem on a rank condition for arbitrarily mixed point, line and plane features. It captures all possible constraints among multiple images of these geometric primitives, and serves as a key to both geometric analysis and algorithmic development. Based on the theory and conceptual algorithms developed in early part of the book, Part IV develops practical reconstruction algorithms step by step, as well as discusses possible extensions of the theory covered in this book. Different parts and chapters of this book have been taught as a one- semester course at the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the George Mason University, and as a two quater course at the University of California at Los Angles. There is apparantly adequate material for lectures of one and a half semester or two quaters. Advanced topics suggested in Part IV or chosen by the instructor can be added to the second half of the second semester if a two-semester course is offered. Given below are some suggestions for course development based on this book: 1. A one-semester course: Appendix A and Chapters 1 - 7 and part of Chapters 8 and 13. 2. A two-quater course: Chapters 1 - 6 for the first quater and Chapters 7 - 10 and 13 for the second quater. 3. A two-semester course: Appendix A and Chapters 1 - 7 for the first semester; Chapters 8 - 10 and the instructor’s choice of some advanced topics from chapters in Part IV for the second semester. Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter. They consist of three types: 1. drill exercises that help student understand the theory covered in each chapter; 2. programming exercises that help student grasp the algorithms developed in each chapter; 3. exercises that guide student to creatively develop a solution to a specialized case that is related to but not necessarily covered by the general theorems in the book. Solutions to most of the exercises will be made available upon the publication of this book. Software for examples and algorithms in this book will also be made available at a designated website.},

abstract = {An offset-free controller is one that drives controlled outputs to their desired targets at steady state. In the linear model predictive control (MPC) framework, offset-free control is usually achieved by adding step disturbances to the process model. The most widely-used industrial MPC implementations assume a constant output disturbance that can lead to sluggish rejection of disturbances that enter the process elsewhere. This paper presents a general disturbance model that accommodates unmeasured disturbances entering through the process input, state, or output. Conditions that guarantee detectability of the augmented system model are provided, and a steady-state target calculation is constructed to remove the effects of estimated disturbances. Conditions for which offset-free control is possible are stated for the combined estimator, steady-state target calculation, and dynamic controller. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate trade-offs in disturbance model design.},

However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},

First, simplified equations of motions for the multi-rotor and slung load are derived. The model is then used to design a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) that can manage the highly nonlinear dynamics whilst accounting for system constraints. The controller is shown to simultaneously track specified waypoints whilst actively damping large slung load oscillations. A Linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) controller is also derived, and control performance is compared in simulation. Results show the improved performance of the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller over a larger flight envelope, including aggressive maneuvers and large slung load displacements. Computational cost remains relatively small, amenable to practical implementation.

Based on an attached inertia measurement unit, a sonar and an optic-flow sensor, the state vector is estimated using sensor fusion algorithms. A novel switching model predictive controller is designed in order to achieve precise trajectory control, under the presence of forcible wind gusts. The quadrotor's attitude, altitude and horizontal linearised dynamics result in a set of piecewise affine models, enabling the controller to account for a larger part of the quadrotor's flight envelope while modelling the effects of atmospheric disturbances as additive-affine terms in the system. The proposed controller algorithm accounts for the state and actuation constraints of the system. The controller is implemented on a quadrotor prototype in indoor position tracking, hovering and attitude manoeuvres experiments. The experimental results indicate the overall system's efficiency in position/altitude/attitude set-point manoeuvres.  2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a versatile framework to enable autonomous flights of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) which has only slow, noisy, delayed and possibly arbitrar- ily scaled measurements available. Using such measurements directly for position control would be practically impossible as MAVs exhibit great agility in motion. In addition, these measurements often come from a selection of different onboard sensors, hence accurate calibration is crucial to the robustness of the estimation processes. Here, we address these problems using an EKF formulation which fuses these measurements with inertial sensors. We do not only estimate pose and velocity of the MAV, but also estimate sensor biases, scale of the position measurement and self (inter-sensor) calibration in real-time. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to obtain a yaw estimate from position measurements only. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of running entirely onboard a MAV performing state prediction at the rate of 1 kHz. Our results illustrate that this approach is able to handle measurement delays (up to 500ms), noise (std. deviation up to 20 cm) and slow update rates (as low as 1 Hz) while dynamic maneuvers are still possible. We present a detailed quantitative performance evaluation of the real system under the influence of different disturbance parameters and different sensor setups to highlight the versatility of our approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated and practical control strategy to solve the leader–follower quadcopter formation flight control problem. To be specific, this control strategy is designed for the follower quadcopter to keep the specified formation shape and avoid the obstacles during flight. The proposed control scheme uses a hierarchical approach consisting of model predictive controller (MPC) in the upper layer with a robust feedback linearization controller in the bottom layer. The MPC controller generates the optimized collision-free state reference trajectory which satisfies all relevant constraints and robust to the input disturbances, while the robust feedback linearization controller tracks the optimal state reference and suppresses any tracking errors during the MPC update interval. In the top-layer MPC, two modifications, i.e. the control input hold and variable prediction horizon, are made and combined to allow for the practical online formation flight implementation. Furthermore, the existing MPC obstacle avoidance scheme has been extended to account for small non-apriorily known obstacles. The whole system is proved to be stable, computationally feasible and able to reach the desired formation configuration in finite time. Formation flight experiments are set up in Vicon motion-capture environment and the flight results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation flight architecture.},

abstract = {Anti-windup strategies for dealing with input constraints date from the earliest stages of automatic control. They are ad-hoc procedures which achieve input saturation in an instantaneous fashion. Not surprisingly, anti-windup methods have a strong appeal to practitioners because of their simplicity. On the other hand, model predictive control (MPC) is a well established strategy for dealing with input constraint problems. The essential feature of the method is a receding horizon optimal quadratic control problem which is solved subject to input constraints. Both methods are known to perform well in practice and each has its strong advocates. In this paper, we explore connections between the methods for constrained single-input linear systems. In particular, we show that there are cases in which anti-windup schemes are identical to MPC schemes. In other cases, we show that anti-windup has performance which is close to that of MPC strategies. These comparisons are facilitated by formulating a general class of anti-windup algorithms in a form which highlights the connection with the state space formulations which are traditionally used in the MPC area.},

abstract = {This paper provides new results for control of complex flight maneuvers for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The flight maneuvers are defined by a concatenation of flight modes or primitives, each of which is achieved by a nonlinear controller that solves an output tracking problem. A mathematical model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics, defined on the configuration space \$\backslash SE\$, is introduced as a basis for the analysis. The quadrotor UAV has four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts; each flight mode is defined by solving an asymptotic optimal tracking problem. Although many flight modes can be studied, we focus on three output tracking problems, namely (1) outputs given by the vehicle attitude, (2) outputs given by the three position variables for the vehicle center of mass, and (3) output given by the three velocity variables for the vehicle center of mass. A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group \$\backslash SE\$ for each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global in each case. Several numerical examples, including one example in which the quadrotor recovers from being initially upside down and another example that includes switching and transitions between different flight modes, illustrate the versatility and generality of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {More than 15 years after model predictive control (MPC) appeared in industry as an effective means to deal with multivariable constrained control problems, a theoretical basis for this technique has started to emerge. The issues of feasibility of the on-line optimization, stability and performance are largely understood for systems described by linear models. Much progress has been made on these issues for non-linear systems but for practical applications many questions remain, including the reliability and efficiency of the on-line computation scheme. To deal with model uncertainty ‘rigorously’ an involved dynamic programming problem must be solved. The approximation techniques proposed for this purpose are largely at a conceptual stage. Among the broader research needs the following areas are identified: multivariable system identification, performance monitoring and diagnostics, non-linear state estimation, and batch system control. Many practical problems like control objective prioritization and symptom-aided diagnosis can be integrated systematically and effectively into the MPC framework by expanding the problem formulation to include integer variables yielding a mixed-integer quadratic or linear program. Efficient techniques for solving these problems are becoming available.},

abstract = {This work presents a small-scale Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) capable of performing inspection tasks in enclosed industrial environments. Vehicles with such capabilities have the potential to reduce human involvement in hazardous tasks and can minimize facility outage periods. The results presented generalize to UAS exploration tasks in almost any GPS-denied indoor environment. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, results from autonomous flights inside an industrial boiler of a power plant are presented. A lightweight, vision-aided inertial navigation system provides reliable state estimates under difficult environmental conditions typical for such sites. It relies solely on measurements from an on-board MEMS inertial measurement unit and a pair of cameras arranged in a classical stereo configuration. A model-predictive controller allows for efficient trajectory following and enables flight in close proximity to the boiler surface. As a second contribution, we highlight ongoing developments by displaying state estimation and structure recovery results acquired with an integrated visual/inertial sensor that will be employed on future aerial service robotic platforms. A tight integration in hardware facilitates spatial and temporal calibration of the different sensors and thus enables more accurate and robust ego-motion estimates. Comparison with ground truth obtained from a laser tracker shows that such a sensor can provide motion estimates with drift rates of only few centimeters over the period of a typical flight.},

However, a typical model also shows a lot of structure that can be exploited in a rather elegant and efficient way. The focus of this paper is on nonlinear models with linear subsystems. With the proposed model formulation, the new auto generated integrators can be considered a powerful generalization of other solvers, e.g. those that support quadrature variables.

@article{Schiano2014,
abstract = {In this paper the problem of estimation and correction of wind effects on a quadrotor UAV, without using wind sensors, is discussed. A large body of research addresses the effects of wind on a quadrotor, however most of them consider it only as a disturbance in their control loop and, for this reason, they solved the problem compensating for the wind with a powerful controller. The main part of this paper is related to the modeling of wind on a quadrotor and to the wind tunnel tests performed at the IFD wind tunnel of ETH Zurich. The approach presented can be used as a starting point for future works. The results obtained in the wind tunnel are really promising for the formulation of a complete aerodynamic model of the quadrotor that has been missing until now.},

@inproceedings{Vukov2013,
abstract = {We present a code generation strategy for handling long prediction horizons in the context of real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). Existing implementations of fast NMPC algorithms use the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme and a condensing technique to reduce the number of optimization variables. Condensing results in a much smaller, but dense quadratic program (QP) to be solved at every time step. While this approach is well suited for short horizons, it leads to unnecessarily long execution times for problem formulations with long horizon. This paper presents a new implementation of auto-generated NMPC code based on a structure exploiting auto-generated QP solver. Utilizing such a QP solver, the condensing step can be avoided and execution times scale linearly with the horizon length instead of cubically. Our simulation results show that this approach significantly decreases the execution time of NMPC with long horizons. For a nonlinear test problem that comprises 9 states and 3 controls on a horizon with 50 time steps, an improvement by a factor of 2 was observed, reducing the execution time for one RTI to below 4 milliseconds on a 3 GHz CPU.},

abstract = {Here, the attitude control of a quadrotor aircraft subject to a class of disturbances is studied. Unlike disturbances mentioned in most of the existing literature, the disturbance considered here is time varying and non-vanished. An extended observer is designed to estimate the disturbance by treating it as a new unknown state. Based on the estimation, a feedback controller with a sliding mode term is designed to stabilise the attitude of the quadrotor. Furthermore, to avoid the discontinuity of the control law caused by the sliding mode term, a modified sliding mode term is designed. The resulting continuous feedback controller makes the attitude error uniformly ultimate bounded. Theoretical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.},
